<p>The Disney Death Tour is a MEmorial, an internet monument that allows
visitors of Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, to recognize the many deaths
that happen within the park that go otherwise completely unacknowledged. Like
the park itself, this tour can be experienced in any order.</p>

<p>That being said, there are two primary interfaces for navigating the park.
The first is to use the map provided in this mobile-friendly website to discover
sites of death throughout the park. The second is to use the Death Tour’s
companion smartphone application, Hidden Mortimers, which allows users to view
emplaced markers throughout the park with the aid of an augmented reality
interface.</p>

<p>The Disney Death Tour is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Walt Disney
Company in any way, although we do welcome them to implement the ideas presented
here into their parks. This is not a critique of the Walt Disney Company or its
practices, but instead a form of parody. This is not to say that we are making a
joke of these deaths, or mocking Disney for unethical practices, but rather that
we are deploying a parodic logic in order to reflect on the abject sacrifices
made as a part of our value system as it relates to entertainment culture.</p>

<p><i>Disney Death Tour is neither endorsed by, nor affiliated with, the Walt
Disney Company. However, we encourage the Walt Disney Company to adopt this tour
as a mockup for installations at their many theme parks worldwide. The tour
operates in part on a logic of playfulness and parody, but it is not intended as
a mockery or critique of the Walt Disney Company, guests of Walt Disney World,
or the many individuals who have lost their lives within the park. Instead,
Disney Death Tour creates a means for visitors of the park to encounter the
deaths that occur within the park.</i></p>

<p>The careful construction and subsequent hypermediation of space at Walt
Disney World offers a useful means of theorizing the ancient Greek notion of
<em>polis</em> (<em>πόλις</em>), in that the park forms a unique body of
citizens apart from the <em>chōra</em> (<em>χώρα</em>) of its surrounding
territories (Orlando and Florida). Walt Disney theme parks are sites of no
discourse—visitors pay a premium for a visceral experience that is meticulously
predetermined and nonnegotiable. These sites exist as an extension of the United
States’ increasingly commercialized democracy, and thus present discrete
opportunities for thinking about how we might renegotiate and restructure civic
potentials, writing publics, and commercial participation in forming spatial
discourses.</p>

<p>It is no secret that Walt Disney World operates at the level of affect and
attraction as opposed to logic. It works not on a paradigm of true/false, but of
attraction/repulsion. Like Proust’s involuntary memory, it strikes directly at
the visceral and intuitive. Or to borrow from Roland Barthes, Disney World
exists as one continuous <em>punctum</em> as it constructs a personal image with and for
us. These parks are designed as spaces that suppress analysis and enhance the
visceral, curated to stress magic, playfulness, happiness, and wonder. As we
explore throughout the webtext portion of this tour, this paradigm excludes
things like accident, death, mourning, and memorial, and in doing so makes them
abject. That being said, Disney <em>does</em> acknowledge death in one unique way,
through their close support of organizations like the Make-A-Wish Foundation, a non-profit
organization that arranges experiences or “wishes” for children diagnosed with
life-threatening illnesses. So while Disney does not allow for deaths that occur
within the park to be acknowledged or memorialized, part of its magical
performance exists to comfort the dying.</p>

<p>Unlike other spaces of public gathering, individual “citizens” of these parks
are barred access from the typical means of civic participation available in
urban spaces, such as organizing protests or leaving memorials.</p>

<p>Thus, if we are to construct a better <em>polis</em>, we must acknowledge the whole
body: corporate, civic, living, dead. One of the many ways this tour makes its
intervention is through examining the consequences that emerge as a result of
the conflation of civic and corporate space assembled within Walt Disney World,
and in turn offering a digital tool for intercalating memorial discourse into
this space. Unlike paranoid conspiracy theories and academic critiques aimed at
Disney’s aesthetic formations, Disney Death Tour is a rhetorical intervention
that operates both as a critical webtext and as an embodied critique designed to
be used within the space of the park. When accessed from a desktop interface,
this webtext offers a distant reading of the park’s spatial configuration
through both its interactive map and this webtext. But when accessed from what
John Tinnell calls the “post-desktop interface” of a mobile phone and the
accompanying augmented reality (AR) interface, this tour forces users to embody
the critique and interact with the space. In doing so, Disney Death Tour also
demonstrates the rhetorical affordances of the technological genres of mapping
and AR as they relate to civic discourse within corporate and commercial
spaces.</p>

<p>There are two ways to take the Disney Death Tour. One method is designed for
the desktop and laptop computer, where one can comfortably read through the tour
as a critical webtext without needing close proximity to the park. The linearity
of this text portion offers only one suggested route, and this portion of the
tour can be taken in any order. The second method is to use the map provided in
this mobile-friendly webtext to discover sites of death throughout the park, as
well as the Death Tour’s companion smartphone application, Hidden Mortimers,
which allows users to view emplaced markers throughout the park with the aid of
an augmented reality interface. These digital tools evolve this webtext into a
location-based and context-dependent critical intervention of Walt Disney World
in Orlando, Florida, offering new rhetorical affordances and potentials for
civic discourse within this otherwise closed corporate space.</p>

<h3>Dealing with the Disney Death Myth</h3>

<p><strong>Did you know?</strong> “It’s company policy... [N]o one dies at
Disney” (<em>Inside the Mouse</em>, 1995, p. 115). According to one of the most
popular urban legends surrounding Walt Disney World, when a tourist with a heart
condition goes lifeless on a roller coaster, medical professionals by decree
must wait to make the death pronouncement off-property. Such a claim suggests
corporate mediation so intrusive as to censor death itself. Whether we can
verify the policy through documentary evidence remains to be seen. However, this
“Disney death myth” characterizes power relations toward the Walt Disney Company
and contributes to the mysterious ethos of the park.</p>

<p>Called a “Vatican with mouse ears” (qtd. in Clément, 2012, p. 6), Disney
wields tremendous influence in Florida, where it employs more people than any
other company in the state, upwards of 56,000. Local government policy often
reflects Disney “flexing its bicep,” as one state senator put it (Garcia &
Damron). In 1967, Florida’s House granted unrivaled autonomy to the company in
the form of a private charter, which allows Disney to operate its parks
independent of “state and county regulation of buildings, land use, airport and
nuclear power plant construction, and even the distribution and sale of
alcoholic beverages” (Foglesong, qtd. in Clément, p. 6). With its propensity for
shaping elections and securing favorable legal conditions, it might not be so
absurd to imagine Disney flexing its muscles to outlaw death too.</p>

<p>Of course, people do die at Walt Disney World. While most deaths result from
pre-existing conditions, others result from accidents on rides or negligence by
park officials. Some result from a horrifying collision of natural and built
worlds, like in 2016, when two year-old Lane Graves was killed by an alligator
at Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort and Spa. All Florida theme parks are required
to report injuries and deaths to the state Department of Agriculture, and Disney
has had to pay regular fines issued by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) for safety violations. However, Disney, like any
corporation, has no obligation to publicize these deaths. In fact, as Graves’
story indicates, these deaths have the potential to become national news anyway.
And despite the Orlando park itself serving in part as a memorial to Walt’s
death,<sup>1</sup> Disney has constructed no such accompanying monuments within the park to
memorialize the numerous deaths of workers and visitors that occur within that
space.<sup>2</sup> But with the use of mobile computing technologies, our “Disney Death
Tour” offers a means of reintroducing these marginalized narratives back into
this restricted write-space, creating the opportunity for users to rewrite their
sensory experience of the park to include collective mourning.</p>

<p>Disney Death Tour commemorates those who have died at Walt Disney World. It
puts commercial tourism in conversation with “critical spatial theory,” Scot
Barnett’s (2012) term for viewing space as “less a fixed, neutral, or
transhistorical idea and more a dynamic, ongoing process of relations involving
people, discourses, objects, ideologies, histories, and the built and natural
environments that together help establish the conditions of lived experience in
the world” (“Psychogeographies of Writing“). As multimodal composition practices
put writing studies into new negotiations with space, Disney theme parks and
other hypermediated corporate spaces become sites where writing technologies
bring new civic potentials into focus. Structured as a guided tour, the Death
Tour redirects the flow of foot traffic and installs an alternative writing of
theme park space that mirrors Jeff Rice’s use of digital logics to renegotiate
traditionally-conceived physical spaces in <em>Digital Detroit</em>. At the same
time, it challenges above all else the supremacy of spatial narratives; it
functions as a  writing, as opposed to another reading, and offers an emplaced
critique as a means of creating civic opportunities for rewriting corporate
space. Ultimately, this project offers a potential  for a continual structuring
and restructuring of space determined by its participants as made possible
through ubiquitous mobile computing technologies.</p>

<p>Gregory L. Ulmer’s concept of the “MEmorial” offers a means of recognizing
and writing communal attitudes towards tragedy. Whereas traditional monuments
enshrine only official values, the MEmorial operates as an internet monument
that facilitates civic practices for rewriting public space to reflect
unofficial values. MEmorials bridge the psychic distance between catastrophe and
complacency by constructing a visceral reminder of abject social sacrifices, in
this case within the tourist industry-at Disney World, via the Death Tour, you
walk among the dead.</p>

<p>As previously noted, he tour (both webtext and embodied versions) can be
experienced in any order, but in terms of our MEmorial practice, it begins with
a single tragedy:</p>

<p><blockquote>Raymond Barlow, 65, was on a platform for the Skyway in
Fantasyland when the cable-car ride was switched on for the park’s opening,
sending one of the gondolas toward the part-time worker. The startled Clermont
resident grabbed the four-person gondola and struggled to pull himself inside,
park employees told investigators. On the way up, he apparently was looking for
a place to land and let go over a flower bed, snapping some tree branches on the
way down, the workers said. (<em>Orlando Sentinel</em>, “Worker At Disney Plunges To
His Death”)</blockquote></p>

<p>Although the Skyway was torn down six months later, and Disney was fined
$4,500 for “a ‘serious’ violation of safety standards,” the <i>Sentinel</i>
reported that “The ride’s closing is not a result of any concerns about its
safety.” As one commenter suggested, “Disney figured it could make better use of
the space.” At the time of this writing, the Magic Kingdom features no marker or
plaque memorializing Barlow’s fall, even though his sacrifice helps maintain
Disney World and, at a different scale, the tourist industry in general. Disney
Death Tour makes use of the space to better recognize similar abject losses.</p>

<p>Barlow’s fall, and Disney’s subsequent response, encapsulate some of the key
spatial principles that the Death Tour explores. Power mediates space both
physically, as in tearing down a ride, as well as through discursive
construction. Conversely, as Sid Dobrin writes, “though one body orders a space
to a particular end, that order is not necessarily recognized or obeyed by all
who enter that space” (40). When entering a Disney park, space is ordered, but
not necessarily obeyed, and the Death Tour provides an alternative option for
occupying the park. Corporations have images to maintain, which for Disney means
preserving its parks’ status as the happiest, most magical places on earth.<sup>3</sup>
Space is carefully arranged to suppress or containerize contradictory
narratives, in this case the deaths of parkgoers and workers. Like a designated
smoking section, Disney confines death to the Haunted Mansion, where the
afterlife follows a safe, playful script. In Barlow’s case, the official story
dismisses any link between safety concerns and the decision to close the Skyway,
but the claims of those constructing the narrative cannot assuage the death
myth’s subversive appeal. To die at Disney is to go off script, and flies in the
face of the wholesome image of perpetual adolescence that the company
cultivates. Without taking this myth’s appeal as factual truth, our Death Tour
magnifies its same subversive logic. As such, we use locative computing
technologies, like the augmented reality (AR) used in this tour’s phone app, to
permit unsanctioned narratives into these hypermediated corporate spaces.</p>

<img class="img-responsive center-block picture" src="img/serling-tower.png"
alt="Rod Serling photo with cigarette removed."/> <div class="caption"> <p>Rod
Serling’s infamous smoking habit is airbrushed out of the Tower of Terror intro
video.</p></div>

<p>Disney scrutinizes what enters and leaves its property such that truth seems
only to circulate in the off-record whispers of its employees:</p>

<p><blockquote>We had a guy last summer who went to EPCOT, stood under the golf
ball, took a gun, and blew his head off. But he didn’t die. He stood right there
in front of all those tourists and went “cluck” and brains blew everywhere. But
he didn’t die there. The medic told me that they are not allowed to let them die
there. Keep them alive by artificial means until they’re off Disney property,
like there’s an imaginary line in the road and they go, “He’s alive, he’s alive,
he’s dead.” (Qtd. in <em>Inside the Mouse</em> p. 115)</blockquote></p>

<p>The Death Tour is premised on an urban legend. If veracity were the only
metric for a narrative’s value, this one hardly satisfies. Online fact-checker
Snopes examines the claim, “Disney can legitmately [sic] claim that no one has
ever died at one of their theme parks, because they always ensure that accident
victims are removed from park property before being declared dead.” Though it
renders a “false” verdict, Snopes acknowledges “This legend is a tricky subject
to tackle, because it’s based upon the fine (and often confusing) distinction
between actual death and declared death.” Actual death becomes declared death
through an act of writing. Literate practices structure life and death through
writing: a birth certificate declares “this person is,” and a gravemarker “this
person was.” The death myth suggests the believable (to the extent that any
legend is believable) potential of Disney to interrupt death through writing. To
clarify, the Death Tour does not literally (or literately) accept the death myth
as law of the land. It instead explores how Disney deaths circulate in a network
of lore, industry, politics, and place-making.</p>

<p>Despite all efforts to control a corporate image, whether sinister or
practical, no imagineer can stop people from dying at Disney. In addition to
Barlow’s, the Death Tour maps over 55 deaths at Disney theme parks since 1977
(although an exact figure is difficult to cobble together). Many were the result
of preexisting conditions or natural causes. Some were freak accidents. In many
cases, families pursued legal action and reached financial settlements with the
Disney Company.</p>

<img class="img-responsive center-block picture"
src="img/Lane-Graves-memorial-lighthouse.jpg" alt="Lane Graves lighthouse
monument."/> <div class="caption"> <p>Disney unveiled the “Lane Thomas
Foundation” monument in honor of Lane Graves.</p></div>

<p>That being said, while the Disney Company downplays death within their parks,
they do engage with it elsewhere. Under less litigious circumstances, Disney
World works with the Give Kids the World charity, offering some source of
comfort for terminally ill children and their families. And in a gesture toward
what Death Tour aims to further articulate, Disney erected a lighthouse statue
in memory of Lane Graves near the site of his death. Make no mistake, this is a
complicated and extremely sad matter. Unlike paranoid conspiracy theories and
academic critiques aimed at Disney’s aesthetic formations, we are operating to
acknowledge these disasters in a serious and respectful way.</p>

<h3>Criticizing the Mouse</h3>

<section class="epigraph"> <p>“Imagine promoting a universe in which raw Nature
doesn’t fit because it doesn’t measure up; isn’t safe enough, accessible enough,
predictable enough, even beautiful enough for company standards.”
<br/>&mdash;Carl Hiassen, <em>Team Rodent</em></p> </section>

<p>Critical approaches to Disney theme parks are nothing new. In 1981 Jean
Baudrillard famously identified Disneyland as the perfect example of
“hyperreality” in <em>Simulacra and Simulation</em>. And in 1995, cultural
studies ensemble The Project on Disney published <em>Inside the Mouse: Work and
Play at Disney World</em>, which conducts an examination of and in Disney theme
parks. In part the book is a model-it weighs the cognitive dissonance of
critics-turned-tourists (“The Problem with Pleasure”), suggests playfully
subversive negotiations of park space (“The Alternative Ride”), and of course
can’t resist a degree of anti-authority snark (“Working at the Rat”). It also
helps circulate the “no one dies at Disney” myth as a counter-narrative that
manages to escape  the hypermediated corporate space of Disney’s parks. The
Project on Disney serves as a precedent, a source for the myth, and ultimately a
point of departure for the Disney Death Tour. Whereas these critical approaches
to Disney offer analytic readings, hermeneutics for the park’s arrangement and
the company’s actions, our approach enacts a writing.</p>

<p>Thibaut Clément’s excellent review of literature, “‘Locus of Control:’ a
Selective Review of Disney Theme Parks,” traces this intellectual suspicion
toward mass entertainment. Efforts to identify the “locus of control”-the where
of meaning-making-in Disney’s parks traversed the high-brow/low-brow debates of
the last century. Critical hostility emerges as early as 1958, when screenwriter
Julian Halevy remarked, “[Disney parks] exist for the relief of tension and
boredom, as tranquilizers for social anxiety” (qtd. in Clément 1). Other voices
saw in Disneyland a restoration of the public sphere, of performance and
participation. Recent work finds the productive rather than pessimistic
possibilities in commercial tourist spaces. As opposed to an early postmodern
view of Disney parks as “sets of signs and representations arranged into a
discourse and intended to blur the distinction between reality and fantasy,”
Clément argues:</p>

<p><blockquote>In assigning various degrees of agency to the parks’
participants, critics have gradually displaced the locus of control for the
parks’ meaning, design, and operations from the Disney corporation to the
individual user and the company’s socio-economic context, paying increasing
attention to the audience’s interpretive activity and the parks’ competitive
environment. (8)</blockquote></p>

<p>He concludes, “Visitors are not ‘cultural dopes’ but rather actively
reconstruct available meanings to elaborate strategies and pursue motives of
their own” (8). Seeking the locus of control shifts from identifying the
presence of agency to the more nuanced assessment of “how much credit the parks’
various participants must be given in shaping and assigning meaning to the
parks’ environment” (9). Disney Death Tour extends “interpretive activity” by
reinscribing the space through digital writing implements. Assigning “credit,”
however, means thinking of writing and writing subjects participating in
complex, networked ecologies. As this project goes on to explore, and as
MEmorials help visualize, a locus of control cannot be neatly accounted for
because writing theory confounds the locus of subjectivity itself.</p>

<p>Including this selection of previous scholarship clarifies Disney Death
Tour’s intentions-what it is, and what it is not. Not an exposé revealing
corporate secrets, nor a critically aloof reading of Disney parks. Neither does
it state the obvious: of course visitors cultivate personal meanings in even the
most mediated of public spaces. Whereas this previous critical work formulates
Disney parks in terms of either the passive reception of signs or the active
construction of individual interpretations, of dominant ideologies or subversive
subjectivities, the Death Tour introduces new methods for civic discourse within
the corporate <em>polis</em> of the park. In an attempt to restructure this
<em>polis</em>, the Death Tour employs a number of methods-MEmorality,
psychogeography, augmented reality, critical tourism, as well as an inquiry into
the limits of those methods.</p>

<p>“To write the disaster is to find the group subject in me. What is to be done
remains open to invention.”
<br/>&mdash;Gregory L. Ulmer, <i>Electronic Monuments</i></p>
</section>

<p>When structured as a MEmorial, Disney Death Tour theorizes how we might write
and rethink our relationship to tourism and entertainment by memorializing those
who have lost their lives at Disney’s various theme parks. By enacting the
MEmorial through an augmented reality application, the parks themselves are
rewritten as sites of mourning and memorial, generating what Ulmer (2005) called
the “inhabitable monument,” a civic practice for an everted network (117). The
emphasis on “me” in “MEmorial” opens an investigation as to how we relate to the
larger structure, in this case Disney’s theme parks, and forces us to confront a
shared experience of tragedy, or in Virilio’s terms, the integral accident built
into the park’s infrastructure. While a traditional memorial might generalize
these losses, a MEmorial “[takes] up the paradox of group subjectivity in
electracy” (118), and experiments with placing the losses of a community in
direct relation with ourselves. As Sean Morey (2017) wrote, a MEmorial allows
individuals to not only witness, but author their experience of a place in order
to manifest individual and collective mourning. In Morey’s Roadkill Tollbooth
MEmorial, digital monuments dispersed along the Gulf Coast and down Highway One
mark sites of significance from the Deepwater Horizon disaster, where “the
traveler must experience the total distance of a distributed memorial, picking
up information and clues from each stop that help understand the next”
(“Roadkill Tollbooth”). Like the markers in Morey’s Tollbooth MEmorial, the
monuments in the Disney Death Tour are distributed throughout the space they
critically index, opening up new avenues for visitors to engage with the park.
And while our desktop site operates as a distance reading of the site of the
park, when accessed from the post-desktop interface of a mobile device it
operates instead as a tour guide that highlights alternative narratives within
the park. The use of augmented reality boosts this effect, and forces users to
enter into the space and interact with it. By doing so, users become what John
Tinnell (2018) calls the “kairotic intellectual,” an author whose discourse
occurs “amid the <em>contingencies of a particular site of local action</em>”
(<em>Actionable Media</em> 217).</p>

<p>As travelers to Disney World in Orlando, we have chosen to confront the
losses of life that have been made invisible as we author our relations to the
<em>polis</em> of the park, and to the <em>chōra</em> of Orlando and Florida at
large. Being citizens of Florida, especially so close to Orlando, means we exist
in an economy emboldened by the tourist and entertainment industries. And being
visitors to Disney’s parks means operating within a community that does not
actively acknowledge the deaths that occur as a result of its existence. As we
move throughout the park, we confront a meticulously cultivated narrative with
the taboo of death; by reconfiguring ourselves within the networks of these
communities, we negotiate values that are not otherwise being acknowledged.</p>

<p>It is important to note that Walt Disney World in Orlando serves as a
monument to Walt Disney, and so in some sense the park’s existence is always
already about death. But within this monument, there are ongoing deaths that are
not recognized, causing dissonance within the community. As an electronic
monument, Disney Death Tour theorizes how we might negotiate this monument to
account for these losses. As Ulmer (2005) stated, “A first step in the design of
a MEmorial is to notice an abject loss that the community acknowledges is a
problem but that is not accepted as a sacrifice on behalf of a belief or value
structuring a group subject” (134). The cultural value of the entertainment
industry necessitates structural deaths just as the cultural value of owning and
driving one’s car necessitates automobile accident fatalities, what Virilio
calls the “general accident.” But rather than critiquing Disney’s narrative as
others have done, we instead offer this monument as an electrate means of civic
engagement, of shifting the park from a space of entertainment to a monument
that reflects a forgotten community value.</p>

<p>Previous MEmorial and AR projects have offered us a precedent on how we might
theorize our monument. Sean Morey’s (2017) “Deepwater Horizon MEmorial Roadkill
Tollbooth” “proposes an electrate alternative to memorializing the disaster of
the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010,” and works to theorize “how we might
write our relationship to <em>nature</em> differently through digital writing
and digital media,” and advocate for public policy change relating to the
disaster. Madison Jones and Jacob Greene’s (2017) “Augmented Vélorutionaries:
Digital Rhetoric, Memorials, and Public Discourse” employs a MEmorial through an
augmented reality mobile phone application that replaces removed ghost bikes,
memorials emplaced by a community to mourn cyclists killed by motor vehicles.
And while not strictly MEmorial projects, Shannon Butts’ “Mobilizing pARis”
(2016) and “Augmenting Atlanta” (2017) projects adopt similar augmented reality
technologies in order to provide alternative tours in places with complex
histories that are abjected or otherwise invisibilized. Disney Death Tour
extends these projects by theorizing how the unique affordances offered through
AR tech and a MEmorial methodology can create new potentials for civic discourse
within closed, corporate, or otherwise hypermediated spaces.</p>

<p>These projects also help configure the Disney Death Tour as what Madison
Jones (2017) described as “emplaced composition,” and as a digital writing
practice that forces us to be writers of the park rather than readers. As stated
earlier, the Disney Death Tour does not aim to critique Disney like countless
others have, but rather to construct an image of the park that includes
ourselves as we relate to otherwise forgotten members of its community, in this
case the dead. By writing our image through multimodal writing technologies, we
are engaging in what Jody Shipka (2011) called “new mediational means,” where we
consider how new tools of mediation alter not only the activities we engage in,
but also how they remediate our relationship to our bodies and surroundings (pp.
48-50). When we configure a MEmorial as a multimodal and emplaced writing
practice, we begin to see composition, in Shipka’s terms, as the result of an
endlessly interconnected chain of events and contexts, which then leads us to
look at what contexts and histories are being privileged (pp. 50-53). In the
case of our critical approach to tourism, it is not enough to simply analyze our
experience in a traditional sense, so we instead turn to an electrate frame of
reference for negotiating our image within the realities of not only Disney, but
also within the operations of the surrounding entertainment culture at
large.</p>

<p>When framing this tour as an electronic monument, we must also reconcile the
fact that we might not like the image we see as we resituate ourselves within an
electrate frame of reference. Morey narrated this sentiment in the denouement of
“Roadkill Tollbooth”:</p>

<p><blockquote>The practice of writing this MEmorial, even in the virtual,
relates to me how I relate to the disaster in the gulf, and how the disaster in
me relates to its cause, and those abject sacrifices which must pay the toll.
Now I must decide, as Ulmer states, if that image is me. If I recognize it, but
don’t like it, then I must produce my own change for the sake of all my
relations.</blockquote></p>

<p>By moving from a reading of the park to a writing of, from hermeneutics to invention, we allow for what Ulmer (2005) described as follows: “I catch sight of my superego by appropriating an event that I recognize as somehow expressive of a feeling. In this scene I recognize not so much my own history as the nature of existence as I believe it to be (a metaphysical intuition).” Or in other words, “I do not explain the problem; it explains me” (p. 138).</p>

<p>“The challenge of the EmerAgency is to show that tourism is capable of
influencing public policy through bearing witness to base sacrifice.”
<br/>&mdash;Gregory L. Ulmer, <i>Electronic Monuments</i></p>

<p>“What occupies space, then, are bodies: specific bodies that mark and identify segments of the space they occupy.”
<br/>&mdash;Sid Dobrin, <em>Postcomposition</em></p>
</section>

<p>Disney Death Tour uses tourism to enact a methodology of location-based and
context-dependent composition. It performs <em>critical</em> tourism-embodied
participation in public writing spaces through commercial travel. In
<em>Postcomposition</em>, Sid Dobrin (2011) opened a space for putting writing
studies in conversation with this definition of travel and tourism. Composition
studies, Dobrin argued, should detach itself from pedagogic practices that serve
to secure territory as a discipline, should move outside the classroom “to
occupy new places” (p. 54). As the military metaphor suggests, occupation often
entails violence, to which a tour organized around death can attest. Occupation
moreover implies embodiment, where body and space work together to determine
place. Disney Death Tour theorizes how  composition studies might occupy new
places not through violence, but through embodiment as critical tourists.</p>

<p>While modern theme parks and tourist attractions are thought of in terms of
their entertainment value, travel also facilities a mode of thinking about
place, and Ulmer (2005) reminds us that the first theorists were also the first
tourists. <em>Theoria</em>, the ancient Greek practice of investigation through
tourism, “implied a complex but organic mode of active observation-a perceptual
system that included asking questions, listening to stories and local myths, and
feeling as well as hearing and seeing” (E. V. Walter, qtd. in <em>Electronic
Monuments</em>, p. 5). These early theorists sought out facts obscured by rumor
and myth. Drawing from theoria, the Death Tour depends on physical travel and
perceptual attunement in its reconfiguring of the <em>polis</em> of Walt Disney
World. As opposed to a strict  fact-finding mission, the tour reopens the park
as a high-profile site for demonstrating the tourist’s place-making
potential.</p>

<h3>From Dark Tourism to Thanatourism</h3>

<p>The Death Tour argues that death always already haunts tourist practices. In
his extended travelogue, “A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do Again,” David
Foster Wallace (1998) models a hermeneutic approach to a stereotypical view of
commercial tourism. Although this tour works against mere interpretation,  “A
Supposedly Fun Thing” highlights the intermingling of death, pleasure, and
hypermediation of space at corporate tourism’s core. Aboard the MV
<em>Zenith</em>, Wallace catalogued the “nearly insanity-inducing pampering” of
an all-inclusive luxury cruise vacation, as well as his own complicity in the
<em>polis</em> aboard the cruise ship.  He attributed the willingness to cede
experiential control-to join the “bovine” (p. 310) herd of tourists-to an
underlying desire to escape death. “A vacation is a respite from
unpleasantness,” Wallace noted, arguing that because of death’s supreme
unpleasantness, passengers on the <em>Nadir</em> “are skillfully enabled in the
construction of various fantasies of triumph over just this death and decay” (p.
264).  As a tourist, observed Wallace, “I pay for the privilege of handing over
to trained professionals responsibility not just for my experience but for my
interpretation of that experience-i.e. my pleasure” (p. 268).While not bitterly
dismissive of the enterprise, Wallace forecloses travel’s
critically-interruptive capacity, canonizing the tacky flip-flops/suntan
lotion/camera-on-gut version of tourism. A more critically aware tourism not
only disrupts similar stereotypes, it encourages invention of counter-narratives
that emerge  from embodied experience; the brochure says go this way, but the
critical tourist has no obligation to obey. To avoid reproducing a containerized
worldview, the Death Tour shifts from analysis to catalysis and invention.</p>

<p>Drawing from the Greek root for death, <em>thanatos</em> (θνῄσκω),
<em>thanatourism</em> (Seaton 1996) describes the allure of death through
travel. Though often used interchangeably with “dark tourism,” thanatourism
connotes a benign, even beneficial, commingling of death and travel. “Dark
tourism,” on the other hand, elicits critique for its “negative valence” and
arbitrary nomenclature (Bowman and Pezzullo 2010). It might seem grotesque, but
the purpose here is not rubbernecking, or “milking the macabre” (Dann 1994).
Instead, in its restructuring of civic and corporate space, the Death Tour
serves as a means of recognizing and reflecting upon community values enshrined
in collective sacrifices, making Walt Disney World theme parks sites of civic
pilgrimage. Or, put another way, the tour operates as a form of memento mori for
a networked civic sphere.</p>

<p>Thanatourism includes visits to battlefields, concentration camps, famous
gravesites, etc.-any attraction to sites of mass death or trauma. A modernist
practice, thanatourism coincides with mass media and culture. As J. John Lennon
and Malcolm Foley (2000) argued in <em>Dark Tourism</em>, for a tourist
destination to be dark, “global communication technologies play a major part in
creating the initial interest” (p. 11). According to Lennon and Foley, the era
of thanatourism begins with two global-scale catastrophes: The First World War,
an unprecedented industrial clash of modern liberal democracies, and the sinking
of the <em>Titanic</em>, a death cruise given spectacular media
coverage.<sup>4</sup> Mirroring Ulmer’s insights in <em>Electronic
Monuments</em>, <em>Dark Tourism</em> posits dark destinations as a means of
reconciling individual experience and mass trauma through personal encounter.
Collective wounds also provoke reflection on the fatal consequences of mass
culture. As Lennon and Foley suggested, “the objects of dark tourism themselves
appear to introduce anxiety and doubt about the project of modernity” (p. 11).
Disney, on the other hand, uses its global media engine to opposite ends, where
the “happiest” or “most magical” places on earth promote what Wallace called
“fantasies of triumph” over death and decay.</p>

<p><em>Dark Tourism</em> demystifies the fascination with death and tourism.
Tourism, as Lennon and Foley read it, grants a means of individual
reconciliation with mass cultural trauma. However, to restrict dark tourism to
battlefields and gravesites presents a limited scope of pre-digested coordinates
on the map. Interpreting particular tourist sites as distinctly “dark” discounts
the role-and the potential-of writing death into spaces designed to obscure it.
Taking into account recent efforts to develop more complex maps of writing,
ecology, space, and subjectivity, <em>thanatourism</em> describes a process of
theorizing, experiencing, and writing death alongside broadly defined public
writing spaces.</p>

<h3>Chōra: Bodies, Minds, and (Disney) World</h3>

<p>The study of rhetoric and composition has entered its space age. An intense
subset of the field seeks the where of writing, what Clément might call the
“locus of control”-how writing and writers shape and are shaped by place.
Previous models of intentional, localized writing subjects often fail to account
for complex interactions of writers, technologies, and environs. Discussed by,
among others, Sid Dobrin, Byron Hawk, Gregory Ulmer, and Thomas Rickert,
<em>chōra</em> helps complicate and expand both static maps of writing as well
as fixed notions of place. As Rickert (2013) explained, “Plato’s <em>chōra</em>
is an ancient attempt to think the relation between matter and activity, work
and space, background and meaning” (p. 42). Applied to writing, <em>chōra</em>
indicates the impossibly complex relational networks that surround and bind the
writing subject. To “theorize subjectivity ambiently,” as Rickert suggested,
abandons the search for fixed loci of control and leaves writing studies with a
necessarily ethereal metaphor.</p>

<p>Ambience furthermore informs this project’s critical approach to tourism. To
contrast with prior hermeneutic readings of Disney World, the Death Tour should
be viewed “in terms of embedded and embodied immersion rather than connection,
dispersed and interactive flow rather than node, conditions of possibility
rather than static presence” (p. 92). In relation to the tourist subject,
<em>chōric</em> place cannot be pinpointed on the map, but rather witnessed as
an “affective, circulating, and evolving series of encounters” (p. 44). Disney’s
Magic Kingdom sits at 28.417663°N latitude, 81.581212°W longitude, but its sense
of place is determined by how people “come together in the continual making of a
place; at the same time, that place is interwoven into the way they have come to
be as they are” (p. <em>xiii</em>).</p>

<p>As we examine in a later section, theories of <i>articulation</i> promisingly
account for rhetorical co-determinacy between human and non-human agents.
Whereas the ethereal metaphor <i>ambience</i> might be difficult to actuate,
articulation makes visible a composition practice which leaves open the
possibility of alternative writings. By engaging with Disney World&mdash;its symbols,
lore, spatial arrangements, and even the absent presence of death&mdash;the tourist
and the tour <i>articulate</i> space in Jacob W. Greene’s (2017) sense to reveal
narrative pathways that are already at the location rather than imposing new
ones. The Death Tour (re)considers Disney World as a place that obscures the
fatal consequences of its very existence, but site-specific death markers only
partially fulfill its intended use as “a responsive way of revealing the world
for others, responding to and put forth through affective, symbolic, and
material means” (Rickert, p. 162). The ambient thanatourist articulates space
according to personal histories, desires, sensations, etc., and space in turn
alters the tourist’s affective makeup. Thus, a map marker merely suggests points
of <i>disclosure</i> in the ambient sense, “itself manifold and ambient; it can
be performed, practiced, and activated in many ways, only so much of which will
at any given time be directly appropriable to consciousness, intention, or
theorization” (72). Each encounter with a Hidden Mortimer has the potential to
alter the thanatourist by exposing her to a previously undisclosed point of
articulation. That point, however, does not determine a particular vector,
making it impossible to project this tour’s intentional impact. Instead,
thanatourism encourages articulation of space as a “process of creating
temporary, contingent connections...through which familiar ideas begin to emerge
as something new” (Greene, 2017), yet never insists upon narrative
supremacy.</p>

Toward a fuller articulation of <em>chōra</em> and <em>polis</em>, this mapping
reintroduces specific deaths, marking sites of the body’s most inescapable
collisions with culture. Disney Death Tour negotiates a rhetoricity of tourism
that is always already thanatourism.</p>

</section>

<p>Disney Death Tour identifies deaths at Walt Disney World in an attempt to
restructure the <em>polis</em> of the park. As such, the goal is to provoke, but
not to insult. In terms of ambient tourism, the goal is not to shame, but to
engage with ambience so “as to (at least potentially) reattune or otherwise
transform how others inhabit the world to an extent that calls for some action”
(Rickert, p. 162). As a counter-narrative to Disney’s hypermediated spaces and
muted depictions of death, the Death Tour provides a means of rumination on some
of the invisible consequences of modern commercial tourism and entertainment.
Within composition studies, this project explores the possibilities of more
electrate writing practices distinct from literate memorialization. The
alternative mapping capabilities enabled through its AR counterpart further
allow us to reintroduce death as a central part of the rhetorical process. Other
MEmorial-inspired projects identify various deaths supporting abject communal
values, often drawing upon “haunting” as a metaphor AR’s revelatory function but
leaving death’s theoretical significance unexamined. The aim is therefore not to
ameliorate theme park fatalities-OSHA exists for that-but to enable civic
discourses of death and memorial into widely shared community considerations of
space.</p>

<p>The Death Tour confronts a tragic and sensitive subject with a methodology
designed to avoid appropriating the dead, insulting the living, or merely
exposing the skeletons in Disney’s closet. Of course, the dead cannot speak for
themselves, and this tour does not presume to write for them. Therefore this
critical tour argues for a new ethics of mapping death, one that confronts
ethical reservations through theories of writing informed by the limitations of
bodily existence. As a writing, the Death Tour responds to appeals from Scot
Barnett (2012) and Diane Davis (2010) to conceive of rhetoric and composition in
ways that resist containerized or instrumentalized representations. Though this
map gives a limited depiction of those who have died at Disney, and where those
deaths occurred, indicating their hidden presence does take a step toward
articulating the dead within a larger networked <em>polis</em> of distributed identity,
what Ulmer (2012) identified as “avatar.”</p>

<p>Barnett’s “Psychogeographies of Writing” challenges compositionists to
acknowledge and work creatively within the “limits of representation” in order
to develop new maps of writing (and in turn write new maps). For Barnett, citing
Judith Butler, writing commits violence when representations expect certainty
from their subjects. Or, in other words, representation seeks essence. On this
map one finds indications of physical death, those who used-to-be-in-the-world.
The challenge is to avoid doubling down on “ethical violence.” Barnett
argued,</p>

<p><blockquote>an act of ethical violence occurs when we ask of the other the
question ‘who are you?’ and demand in return a satisfactory response capable of
presenting a clear and coherent image of the other’s self. Though often couched
in the name of ethics, such acts, Butler has argued, nevertheless demand of the
other something she cannot possibly provide&mdash;namely, an account of the self that
is self-identical with the ‘I’ in whose name she speaks.
(“Psychogeographies”)</blockquote></p>

<p>Articulating death merely exacerbates writing’s failure to represent what not
even the living other can present as a coherent self.</p>

<p>In one sense, this alternative mapping of Walt Disney World turns a
smartphone into a can of spray paint, inscribing a corporate space with
unsanctioned writings. Problematizing these rebellious assumptions, Barnett
argued that “although attempting to unmask and demystify hidden power relations
can satisfy in the short term, doing so also has the potential to leave in place
the very thing we hoped to transcend-in this case the problem of yet another
representation of space quietly asserting its own truth or authenticity.” Yes,
Disney Death Tour attempts to demystify the corporate control of space at work
in Walt Disney World, but rather than insisting on one interpretation of Disney
(a reading), a focus on the writing-tourist shifts attention to what Barnett
described as “those irreducible aspects of embodied being-in-the-world that
haunt the accounts we offer of ourselves but that may never find a comfortable
place in the discourses we rely upon to represent and memorialize those
accounts.” Critical tourism is the participation in a contest for writing spaces
through travel, and involves the embodied experience of existing in a <em>polis</em>. In
light of Barnett’s admonishments, composition scholars must be careful not to
replace one totalizing narrative with another, and instead acknowledge the
limits of critiques contingent upon the limits of representation. This project
treats skeptically the notion of simply preserving and retrieving the memory of
the dead through writing and mostly avoids those questions altogether. Through
augmented reality and electrate mapping, the question instead becomes how do we
“see without knowing,” as Barnett calls for?</p>

<p>Throughout the process of compiling names, dates, and accounts of deaths at
Disney, the Death Tour depends on journalism. It could not exist without the
<em>Orlando Sentinel</em>’s accident database, for example, which, incomplete as it is,
only demonstrates the shortage of accessible information on the topic.<sup>5</sup> But to
approach the Death Tour as mere exposé wades once again into the deficiencies of
archival records. Literate representation offers certain affordances and
limitations, which opens up the need for inventing new digital practices for
civic engagement in hypercontrolled spaces. Another prominent inquiry into death
exemplifies literacy and eletracy’s divergent concerns: during 12 episodes of
the long-form journalism podcast <em>Serial</em>, Sarah Koenig (2014) examined the 1999
murder of high school student Hae Min Lee.<sup>6</sup> Adnan Syed, the man imprisoned for
the crime, insists on his innocence. Episode one begins with a memory exercise:
try to recall in detail what you were doing six weeks ago. If the task proves
difficult to answer with certainty-and as Koenig’s experiment reveals, accounts
are often revised or conflicting-then consider that 1999 was 18 years ago at the
time of this writing. Koenig weighed Syed’s claim of innocence against archival
records, witness testimonies, and expert opinions, but the season finale leaves
personal and legal judgments about Adnan Syed unresolved and perhaps even
unresolvable. <em>Serial</em> demonstrates that even thorough works of investigative
journalism depend on the limits of written memorialization as a part of their
praxis.</p>

<p>Journalistic objectivity tends toward containerization, the demand to know
for the record. When a figure like Syed resists tidy representations, and when a
journalistic account reaches its disciplinary limits, the result can be
frustrating. As one commenter exclaimed in episode eight, “Well then who the
fuck did it?” In its expletive-inducing journalistic restraint, <em>Serial</em> reaches
the very limits of literate memory practices. Koenig ended with a big “I don’t
know,” not for certain anyway. Her exhaustive diligence not to reduce the
complexities of lived experience to a snappy story resembles a Butlerian
journalistic ethic. Working as an extension beyond the limitations of literate
journalism, the MEmorial genre then “begins with a sting (punctum) received from
a news item, a story from the daily dose of information circulated by
journalism” (Ulmer, p. 118). Electrate writing practices do not displace but
extend literate journalism. In response to Barnett, MEmorial projects seek not
better containers, but alternative approaches.</p>

<h3>Thinking without Knowing</h3>

<p>As discussed in the Thanatourism section, emplacement forwards an ethics
attuned to the material specifics of place, engaged locally, in detail, rather
than in abstract tropes. In this sense, emplacement resembles a journalistic
project. To avoid containing the irreducible complexities of lived experience to
the obituary section of the newspaper, it becomes essential to work past
journalism as memorialization and into the theoretical possibilities of
MEmorialization as an electrate writing practice for civic engagement. Though it
may be impossible to substitute writing for the memory of lived experience, the
Death Tour opens a consideration of death’s rhetoricity.</p>

<p>In her introduction to <em>Inessential Solidarity</em>, Diane Davis argued that what
Butler and Barnett treat as concerns to be avoided are in reality impossible
altogether: “There is no longer any way to pose [ontology’s] defining question,
a question of uncontaminated essence: ‘What is X?’ There is no immanent or
intrinsic being, no essence in itself that would therefore be capable of
presenting itself as such” (p. 4). Davis shifts the stakes from taxonomical to
rhetorical and theoretical. Drawing extensively from Emmanuel Levinas and
Jean-Luc Nancy, she identified a “preoriginary rhetoricty” in the condition of
distributed being. According to Nancy, being is always already contaminated by
community and environs; the “singularity” of the individual “designate[s]
precisely that which, each time, forms a point of exposure, traces an
intersection of limits on which there is exposure. To be exposed is to be on the
limit where, at the same time, there is both inside and outside, and neither
inside nor outside.” This exposure, Davis said, “[Precedes] symbolic
identification … is relationality as such; it is constitutive of being, which is
always and only in the mode of exposition and not essence” (p. 7). Barnett’s
project seeks pre-reflective aspects of being-in-the-world. Davis finds in the
world a being-with that is always a being-for, a “solidarity that precedes
symbolicity” (p. 15).</p>

<p>“A Rhetoric of Responsibility” makes it clear that the role of dying at
Disney extends beyond mere morbid fascination. Nancy wrote, “what community
reveals to me, in presenting to me my birth and my death, is my existence
outside myself” (p. 10). As Davis put it, “Death marks the absolute limit of
identification and (so) of understanding … ‘my’ finitude…can communicate itself
to me only through ‘your’ mortality.” Levinas’ use of “face” refers to both
physical, face-to-face, presence disrupting indifference, and to what Davis
called “the site of ‘my’ encounter with the inassimilable alterity of the other,
which provokes an interruption in identification and cognition.” She continued,
“What one encounters in the face to face is the other’s finitude, the other’s
exposedness-that is to say, both his or her mortality…” (p. 12). By pinpointing
Disney deaths down to latitude and longitude, the Death Tour literalizes the
processes of exposure in order to visualize sites of encounter. Disney Death
Tour puts the Walt Disney World <em>polis</em> face-to-face with death.</p>

<p>This rhetorical look at death at Disney is not intended to reduce the
complexities of rhetorical being(s) to simple map markers, but to articulate a
reminder that, as Davis argued, “Responsibility kicks in as a response to
finitude’s deadly intensity” (p. 11). Barnett tasks composition with finding
ways of “seeing without knowing.” If the impulse to know risks ethical violence,
Davis’ theorization of preoriginary rhetoric offers a productive direction:
“Thinking is not the same as knowing, and the challenge today, the social,
ethical, and political challenge is to learn to think the sharing of community
without effacing precisely this sharing by conceptualizing it, turning it into
an object to be grasped and put to work” (p. 8). Death depictions like those at
the Haunted Mansion offer a scripted version of death without consequences. They
are not sites of encounter with one’s own mortality, and are certainly not
intended to be. In response to Disney’s glossy performances of death, the Death
Tour inscribes Walt Disney World with “Hidden Mortimers,” grave markers with
mouse ears that play on the “Hidden Mickeys” scattered throughout Disney parks.
Whereas headstones operate as a literate exercise in representation, perhaps
these map markers operate as facestones, renderings of death’s finitude. At
these sites of encounter, “The face comes through each time as pure appeal,
persuasion without a rhetorician” (p. 14). Ultimately, the Death Tour indicates
not just death, but being’s underlying solidarity, being-<em>for</em>, realized when
“communal life holds itself ‘at a level equal to death’” (p. 10).</p>

<p>Obviously this formulation of space applies everywhere, not just Disney
World. But if we accept Davis’s preoriginary rhetoricity, and death as our new
standard, then what’s needed is not better representations of death in space,
but more useful reminders. Furthermore, inventing alternative and electrate
writing practices often means the playful coining of neologisms and repurposing
of old terms through puns. In our case, death’s rhetorical appeal means
renegotiating the theme “park” to include inertia, pause, and recognition.</p>

<p>“The MEmorial is a form of humanities visualization of data sets,
giving insight into large-scale complex processes and events within an
arts and letters frame of reference.”
<br/>&mdash;Gregory Ulmer, <i>Electronic Monuments</i></p>

<p>“Hollis approached the body. That wasn’t there. But was. Alberto
followed her with the laptop, careful of the cable. She felt as if he were
holding his breath. She was holding hers.”
<br/>&mdash;William Gibson, <i>Spook Country</i></p>
</section>

<p>William Gibson’s (2007) novel <em>Spook Country</em> features an avant-garde augmented
reality artist, Alberto Corrales, who creates “invisible virtual monuments” to
dead celebrities as art installations throughout Hollywood (p. 49). Corrales’
first installation features the reenacted death of River Phoenix outside of the
Viper Lounge, Johnny Depp’s nightclub in West Hollywood. Like all of Corrales’
installations, the scene of the death is viewed through an AR-capable headset at
the site of its occurrence, and thus exists as a mixed reality, location-based
composition. If everyone had these headsets, Corrales envisioned, “the world we
walk around in would be channels” (p. 46). Of course, with the ubiquity of the
smartphone, everyone<sup>7</sup> now does walk around with these headsets in a way, and
these channels are increasingly being realized. This is one of many ways Gibson
explored the rise of ubicomp, AR, and locative media throughout the novel as a
means of amending the “cyberspace” metaphor he first coined in “Burning Chrome,”
and later popularized in <em>Neuromancer</em>. Gibson called his updated metaphor
“eversion,” the idea that the network is no longer imagined as an ethereal
substratum existing in a second order to humans, but rather a physical artifact
with tangible relations and consequences.</p>

<p>The eversion metaphor echos digital humanities scholar Steven Jones’ (2014)
claim of augmented reality’s primacy as our contemporary metaphor for digital
spaces. Jones claimed: “the augmented has displaced the virtual, and computing
has gone mobile and locative;” AR, or mixed reality’s collapsing of digital and
physical spaces, forces the construction of new practices and questions that
“address the social, locative, embodied, and object-oriented nature of our
experience in the networked world” (p. 14). To this end, the Death Tour serves
to enact an everted critique at the site of Disney’s Magic Kingdom, an embodied
and site-specific mixed reality intervention that invites park visitors to
negotiate the narratives and dimensionalities they experience throughout the
park.</p>

<p>Our choice of augmented reality as the specific medium for constructing the
Death Tour serves dual functions. The first is simple pragmatism-the AR
apparatus provides a means of interfacing with an everted network, one of
Corrales’ “channels,” in a mobile, streamlined manner. In this sense it follows
Andries van Dam’s (1997) claim that “the best interface is no interface-‘I
think, therefore the computer gives me what I thought about (and what I should
think about)’” (p. 64). In other words, the AR underpinnings enable a clean
electrate app/aratus that is both immediate and unburdensome, a pocket-sized
countermonument that operates without the cumbersome headset imagined in
Gibson’s novel. Second, AR as a medium holds deeper significance for the ways in
which this project is rendered. As such, we take up Lev Manovich’s (2006) call
in “The poetics of augmented space” to “reconceptualize augmentation as an idea
and cultural and aesthetic practice rather than as a technology” (p. 220).
Marshall McLuhan’s famous quip throughout <em>Understanding Media</em>, “the medium is
the message,” certainly holds sway here. But perhaps more aptly, we take up Neil
Postman’s claim that the medium is instead the <em>metaphor</em>. The AR metaphor enacted
through the Disney Death Tour is not one as distasteful as communing with
spirits or disturbing a haunted space, but instead one that implements AR as a
poetics for interfacing with erasure. As Greene and Jones (2017) argued,
“location-based AR criticism operates rhetorically not to overwhelm the user
with information, statistics, and research but rather to open up affective
avenues through which alternative public discourses about a location might
emerge.” In other words, we are not interested in communing with the “spooks”
from Gibson’s <em>Spook Country</em> (which he defined as both “specter, ghost, revenant”
and “slang for ‘intelligence agent’”<sup>8</sup>), but rather in how an augmented medium
both theorizes and catalyzes a negotiable public discourse through approaching
its design and implementation as, in Manovich’s words, “an architectural
problem.” By creating digital memorials at fixed locations within the park, this
AR application invites park visitors to ritualize and reflect on the
augmentations with which they choose to interface.</p>

<p>Nathan Jurgenson (2016) put this similarly in “Always Already Augmented,” a
reflection on the location-based AR game <em>Pokémon Go</em>:</p>

<p><blockquote>[I]t is misleading to oppose the real to the augmented. Wandering
through town we encounter a deeply augmented reality even if we are not playing
<em>Pokemon Go</em>, not carrying a screen with us. From billboards overhead to
the sounds of music from passing cars to the architecture of surrounding
buildings to the city planning it all rests on, reality is augmented everywhere
at every moment. And that’s not even considering the deeper augmentations of
cultural norms, or the structures of language itself. Language is built on
“augmenting” what is “here and now” with a record of ideas and people and
actions that transcend time and space and presence.</blockquote></p>

<p>For Jurgenson, “reality” is only distinguishable from “augmented reality” in
that its augmentations have been naturalized and thus operate invisibly. What
<em>Pokémon Go</em> offers is a disruption of this naturalization, one that makes certain
augmentations more readily apparent, or, to borrow from Rickert, provides
“salience.” Greene (2017) echoed this claim, arguing that the word “articulate”
might be a more apt term. “Whereas ‘augmentation’ ascribes to a rhetoric of
addition-as-improvement, ‘articulation,’...encourages us to approach
location-based AR design as a process of creating and identifying emergent
connections between the digital content of the application and its material
surroundings.” Greene further argued that articulation “serves as a useful
theoretical framework for understanding how temporary, contingent relations
create emergent patterns of meaning.” In memorializing those who have died at
Disney, the Death Tour articulates the architectural discourse of the park to
provide recognition for the deaths made invisible within the park’s construction
and through its institutional policies.</p>

<p>Ulmer (2005) argued that conventional memorials operate in accordance with a
“public, collective value” in order to commemorate a sacrifice made. As we have
mentioned earlier, Orlando’s Magic Kingdom was constructed as a monument to Walt
after his death, and our peripheral thus negotiates that monument by continuing
it and, in Ulmer’s words, “open[ing] to further thought the relation between
private and public experience, individual and collective actions, events,
behaviors” (p. 130). Due to its reliance on triggers tied to the location of the
deaths, the app renegotiates users’ movement through the park as a process of
rearticulating their private relations to this public sacrifice. In constructing
this electronic monument, our goal is not to instrumentalize those who have lost
their lives towards a condemnation of the Disney Company, but rather to
ritualize our tourism as a means of restructuring the civic body of the
park.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <p><sup>7</sup> Of course, this mostly applies to the privileged, industrialized
  world’s experience of tech. Or, as Gibson puts it, “the future is already here –
  it’s just not evenly distributed.”</p>
  <p><sup>8</sup> Gibson omitted the racial slur from his definition.</p>

<section class="epigraph">

<p>“By an extraordinary coincidence (but this derives without a doubt from
the enchantment inherent to this universe), this frozen, childlike world
is found to have been conceived and realized by a man who is himself now
cryogenized: Walt Disney, who awaits his resurrection through an increase
of 180 degrees centigrade.”
<br/>&mdash;Jean Baudrillard, <i>Simulacra and Simulation</i></p>
</section>

<h3>Memento (ME)mori(al)</h3>

<p>While the myth of Walt’s cryogenically frozen body is certainly compelling,
it is also undeniably untrue. Baudrillard’s mythologizing of Disney enacts the
same kind of covering up that critics of the Disney Company so often hinge their
critiques on. In reality, Walt was cremated two days after his death, which
resulted from complications from lung cancer (Gabler, 2011, p. 626). Walt was a
heavy smoker for much of his life, and it led to his death in 1966 at the age of
65.</p>

<p>Rearticulating the <em>polis</em> of Walt Disney World through the Death Tour
necessitates consideration of the ways The Walt Disney Company itself
articulates death throughout its parks. Most notable is the case of Walt
himself, whose many portraits and various other photographs throughout the park
have had the cigarettes carefully airbrushed from them. In these photos Walt
points delicately with two fingers towards nothing, or rests them awkwardly in
front of him; some of these images still contain a faint trail of smoke from the
missing cigarette, a secondhand reminder of what killed Walt (Cade, 2016). Tom
Hanks even mimicked the artificial two-finger point in his portrayal of Walt in
the 2013 film <em>Saving Mr. Banks</em>, yet another depiction void of smoking but not of
smoke (Buerger, 2013). We are not interrogating the ethics of a revisionist
approach to Walt’s image here, but would like to emphasize that obscuring the
realities of death has been a part of this park’s history from its
inception.<sup>9</sup></p>

<p>That being said, there is one location at Walt Disney World that does portray
death-the Haunted Mansion, the Orlando version of which opened in 1971. No
deaths have been reported on the ride, but that has not negated its mythic
depth. One ride operator explains that the ride shuts down several times a year
to clean up ashes spread by park guests, presumably of loved ones who held a
meaningful connection to the ride. When inquiring if the ashes are collected and
stored somewhere, we were told that the process instead involves brooms and
vacuums. While this is a rumor in the strictest sense, it would indicate that
the playful irreverence of the attraction might bleed into the logic of yet
another of Disney’s death procedures. Highlighting this example suggests that a
playful logic at Disney can have stark consequences, and that a subtle shift in
this logic, borrowing from electracy, can hold meaningful sway in constructing a
spirited, inclusive image of death in collective mourning.</p>

<p>And perhaps this used to be the case. Memento Mori, the gift shop peripheral
of the Haunted Mansion, once sold customizable death certificates, playful
compositions that juxtaposed the living with the dead. While these are no longer
available for purchase, the shop now offers “Spirit Photographs,” personalized
8x10" holographic portraits that, upon tilting, morph one’s face into that of a
ghoul’s. And even today the ghouls and phantoms darting around within the walls
of the Haunted Mansion engage in some of the only implementation of augmented
reality within the park, as if Disney itself were instrumentalizing the
technology as one way of communing with the dead. Their mixed reality dancing
indeed inspired our own haunting of the park, our own Spirit Photography that
works within the preexisting electrate logics of Walt Disney World.</p>

<h3>Monumental Mice</h3>

<p>It goes without saying that Mickey Mouse serves as more than just the
official mascot of The Walt Disney Company, but also one of the most famous
cartoon characters in the world. However, the iconic mouse was originally named
Mortimer, a name often associated with death and the grim reaper, with clear
etymological traces to Middle English and Latin (<em>mors</em> and <em>mort</em>-, death).<sup>10</sup> At
the behest of Walt’s wife Lillian, the name was changed to Mickey, on the basis
of the name Mortimer being too pretentious. But Mortimer did eventually become a
character in the Disney Universe, making his first appearance as the villain
“Mr. Slicker” in the 1930 comic strip “Mr. Slicker and the Egg Robbers,” and his
first appearance with the name Mortimer Mouse six years later in the animated
short “Mickey’s Rival,” where he firmly cements his place in Disney’s history as
Mickey’s primary antagonist.</p>

<p>A psychoanalytic or hermeneutic reading might view Mortimer Mouse as a
repressed death drive or id. Suppressing the mouse’s true Mortimer nature by
naming him Mickey causes a villain bearing the name to surface. Of course, the
Death Tour considers Mortimer in a different sense-instrumentalizing him as a
mascot for death within the borders of Disney World. Although most other
villains have their own mascots within the park, there has never been a live
Mortimer.</p>

<p>The Death Tour implements the Mortimer mascot to rewrite the images of hidden
deaths throughout the park. The Hidden Mortimers riff off of Disney’s “Hidden
Mickeys,” the concealed insertions of the iconic tri-circle Mickey head
throughout Disney parks. Just as Hidden Mickeys started as an in-joke between
early Disney Imagineers and has become a favorite means of secretly
participating in the parks’ community (Roseboom, 2011), the Death Tour begins as
a shared but hidden means of rewriting the park, one offered up to the larger
community. And just as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Dr. Mortimer asked Sherlock
Holmes to investigate the death of his friend in <em>The Hound of the Baskervilles</em>,
so too do these Mortimers call for a closer examination, a second look at what
it means to be a visitor of the parks. This memento mori is not a morbid or
repressed action, but rather an attempt at an electrate reflection on death.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <p><sup>9</sup> Of course, removing images of cigarettes is also about the
  unpopularity or negative opinions of smoking. Smoking’s own death. We do think
  Disney is acting responsibly in this case.</p>
  <p><sup>10</sup> It’s also important to note that Mickey Mouse’s design was
  influenced by early 20th century caricatures of blackface, as detailed
  throughout the collection <em>A Mickey Mouse Reader</em>, edited by Gary Apgar.</p>

  <p>“He was looking for a place to fall. He didn’t want to fall on the concrete, so he fell on the flower bed.”
  <br/>&mdash;Deputy Robert Larson, Orange County Sheriff’s Office</p>
</section>

<p>According to some stories, Orlando was originally known as “Orlando’s Grave,”
named after Orlando Reeves, an American soldier killed during the Second
Seminole War. Other stories say Reeves was killed while attempting to fire a
warning shot. Despite an impressive, weighty gravestone noting the city being
named in honor of Reeves, most historians agree not only that the city was not
named for him, but that the man likely never even existed.</p>

<img class="img-responsive center-block picture" src="img/orlandoreeves.png" alt="Image of Orlando’s grave."/>

<p><strong>Kenny:</strong> I wouldn’t be mapping death if my mother
hadn’t told the story of Raymond Barlow falling to his death from an overhead
cable-car system when I was a kid. My mom worked for the company for years, and
like many employees eager to share insider knowledge, she too swore that no one
actually dies at Disney. She would, however, happily take the family to the
parks and point out where the incidents occurred&mdash;the original Disney Death Tour.
In many ways the theme parks have always been a death tour for me, but I never
wanted this project to be a monumental middle finger to Disney. Sometimes Disney
is a <em>memento vivere</em>; My sister was born with a life-threatening heart condition,
and to celebrate her first year as a survivor, we took her to Disney. Growing up
so entwined with Disney always meant acknowledging the Magic Kingdom as a place
where a man fell to his death and landed in a bed of flowers.</p>

<p><strong>Jason:</strong> As a Florida transplant, and having never visited
Walt Disney World as a kid, the practice of constructing this tour has a
different resonance with me than with Kenny. My first trip to Disney World was a
death tour, where the official park space served as a palimpsest for the local
folklore provided by new Florida friends welcoming me to their home. And while I
will admit to an initial deep cynicism towards Disney, its overall design caused
us to pursue approaches, what Ulmer calls “conductive reason,” that would not
have been possible with other places. In constructing this electronic monument I
relate myself not only to the tragedies that go unrecognized within the park,
but also to the local communities that allow the park to exist.</p>
